.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function assigns a
.Qq multi-data
source set
.Fa d
to a plotting context
.Fa p ,
reference-counting the data sources in the process.
See
.Xr kplot_attach_data 3
for a more general description of attaching data.
Multi-data source sets consist of a baseline and one or more pair lines,
for example, a curve and its error bars.
The most common usage is for graphing mean (the baseline) and standard
deviation above and below (pair lines) via
.Xr kdata_mean_alloc 3
and
.Xr kdata_stddev_alloc 3 .
The order in which you arrange the array parameters
.Fa d ,
.Fa t ,
and
.Fa cfg :
the first is for the baseline, subsequent are for pair lines as defined
by
.Fa st .
The
.Fa cfg
argument can be
.Dv NULL
.Pq as can individual array entries ;
all other parameters and indexes must not be
.Dv NULL .
The plot types are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv KPLOTS_YERRORLINE
Draw a baseline (or points) using the first element in
.Fa d .
The next element is used to draw error lines (or points) above (adding
to the y-position) and below (subtracting) the baseline.
Subsequent lines are ignored.
Data sources are matched by bucket index,
.Em not
x-axis value, which is ignored for all pair data sources.
.It Dv KPLOTS_YERRORBAR
Draw a baseline (or points) using the first element in
.Fa d .
The next element is used to draw error lines (or point) above (adding to
the y-position) and below (subtracting) the baseline.
A bar is then drawn between these points using the line configuration of
this element.
Subsequent lines are ignored.
Data sources are matched by bucket index,
.Em not
x-axis value, which is ignored for all pair data sources.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns 0 if allocation of internal structures fails due to memory
exhaustion, or not enough data sources have been provided.
In this case, all allocations and references will be dropped.
