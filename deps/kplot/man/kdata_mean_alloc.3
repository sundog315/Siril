.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kdata_mean_alloc
.Nd allocate mean data for plotting
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkplot
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In cairo.h
.In kplot.h
.Ft "struct kdata *"
.Fo kdata_mean_alloc
.Fa "struct kdata *source"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm kdata_mean_alloc
creates a reference-counted data sources for
.Xr kplot 3 .
It attaches to zero or more existing data sources and, when they update
their values per-index, tracks the mean of the sequence of updated
values.
Thus, if a mean data source is attached to two sources, its y-value for
pair zero will reflect the mean of all values set to pair zero's
y-value in the sources.
Note that the indexing is absolute: if attached to a bucket or
histogram, pair index zero refers to the first internal data storage,
not storage mapped from the bucket or histogram.
.Pp
If
.Fa source
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the internal buffer is initialised to the size of the source and all of
its x values.
The mean is initialised to zero with zero updates.
Otherwise, the internal buffer is sized to zero.
.Pp
Further data sources may be attached with
.Xr kdata_mean_attach 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns
.Dv NULL
if memory allocation failed.
