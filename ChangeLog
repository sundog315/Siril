siril 0.9.0
10/16/15

* new global star registration, taking into account field rotation
* new quality evaluation method for planetary images, used to sort the best
* images selected for stacking
* new parallelized stacking algorithm for all sequences, including all SER formats, allowing maximum used memory to be set
* threading of the most time consuming processings, to keep the GUI reactive, as well as many other speed improvements
* tested and improved on FreeBSD and MacOS X systems, and ARM architectures
* undo/redo on processing operations
* sequence cropping tool


siril 0.9.0rc1
12/29/14

* many fixes including background extraction, compositing alignment, rejection algorithm, wavelets
* threading of the heavy computations, to avoid graphical user interface freezing and provide a nice way of seeing what is happening in the console window
* image rotation with any angle (not in registration yet)
* new Canon banding removing tool
* GTK+ version is now 3.6 or above

* better image sequence handling with non-contiguous sequences, but still requiring file names to be postfixed by integers
* new graphical user interface based on GTK+ version 3.4 and above
* new display modes added to the standard linear scaling with lo/hi bounds
* manual translation as new registration method with two preview renderings of the current image with reference frame in transparency
* automatic translation as new registration method for deep-sky images, based on the PSF analysis of one star
* new commands available for the command line
* a star finding algorithm with PSF information
* new background extraction tool
* new processing functions
* new image compositing tool
* new stacking methods with rejection algorithms
* numerous bugs fixed and internal code refactoring
